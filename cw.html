                Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is set during the Cold War in the early 1980s. The story follows Green Beret turned CIA SAD/SOG operative Russell 
                Adler and his mission to stop a USSR extremist group in 1981.The story is inspired by actual events and the campaign features locations such as East
                Berlin, Vietnam, Turkey, and the Soviet KGB headquarters.Adler is supported by Call of Duty: Black Ops characters Mason, Woods and Hudson. 
                With new characters being Adler's MACV-SOG friend Sims, Mossad fixer Lazar, and MI6 officer Park. Players assume a custom character for the campaign,
                codenamed “Bell”, with the ability to choose their intelligence agency, skin tone, nationality, and gender; as well as different personality traits 
                that provide in-game perks. The campaign features multiple endings, dependent on player choice throughout the campaign.

                Multiplayer features new and returning game modes, as well as maps that accommodate both the traditional 6v6 format, as well as larger 12v12 combat. 
                The game also introduced a new game mode named "Fireteam", which can support up to 40 players. The Create-a-Class system from Modern Warfare returns, 
                with two major differences: field upgrades are implemented as part of class loadouts, and each class has a wildcard choice out of four possible ones: 
                Gunfighter (allows up to 8 primary weapon attachments), Perk Greed (allows 2 perks from each perk type for a total of 6 usable perks), Danger Close 
                (double grenade equipment), or Lawbreaker (allows mixing and matching any weapon/perk type in any slot). Like Modern Warfare, Cold War also support
                cross-platform play and cross-platform progression. Following an update, the progression system for multiplayer is integrated with Call of Duty: 
                Warzone, allowing for a unified level system across Cold War, Warzone and Modern Warfare. In addition, Operator characters and weapons from Cold War
                are also added to Warzone to be used alongside Modern Warfare Operators and weapons, though the multiplayer modes remain separated and do not share 
                Operators and weapons.
