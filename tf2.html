            <p>  Titanfall 2 is a first-person shooter video game, developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. 
                 A sequel to 2014's Titanfall, the game was released worldwide on October 28, 2016, for Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. In Titanfall 2, 
                 players control Titans, mecha-style exoskeletons and their pilots, who are agile and equipped with a variety of skills ranging from wall-running 
                 to cloaking. Set in a science fiction universe, the single-player campaign follows the story of Jack Cooper, a rifleman from the Frontier Militia,
                 who bonds with his mentor's Titan BT-7274 after his mentor is killed in action. Together, they embark on a quest to stop the Interstellar 
                 Manufacturing Corporation (IMC) from launching a superweapon that is threatening to destroy the Militia planet Harmony.

                 The game's two-year development cycle began in mid-2014. The decision to add a single-player campaign to the game came about because the team 
                 wanted to expand the game's player base. They came up with different ideas and prototypes, and integrated them to form a single coherent campaign.
                 Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet and buddy cop films, as well as the video game Half-Life inspired the game's campaign and narrative. 
                 The team also overhauled the progression system and made subtle changes to the multiplayer to make the gameplay more fair. 
                 A heavily modified version of Valve's Source engine powers the game. Stephen Barton returned to compose the game's music.

                 Upon release, the game received critical acclaim. The single-player campaign was praised for its design and execution, and the multiplayer 
                 modes for building on the foundation of the original game. Despite the positive reception, Titanfall 2 underperformed commercially, 
                 with most attributing its underwhelming performance to going on sale in a crowded release window, placed between the release of 
                 Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. It was nominated for multiple year-end accolades, including Game of the Year and 
                 Best Shooter awards, by several gaming publications. Respawn continued to support the game after its release, providing several updates and 
                 downloadable content.
